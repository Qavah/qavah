# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Qavah?
https://qavah.me is a decentralized and free-of-charge crowdfunding platform running on [Celo](https://celo.org/), a carbon-negative blockchain.

## How does it work?
*Qavah* is a Hebrew word meaning "to wait, to hope for something". That's the idea behind that website: to become a place where hope is fueled. Through many small contributions, *to empower individuals so that they can build a more sustainable future*.  
Practically speaking, every campaign can be backed by potentially up to 100 users, who receive in return little pieces of the whole pictureâ€”a reminder that when people gather, big things are made possible.

## Who can create a campaign?
Everybody can, you'll just need a crypto wallet and some CELO to pay for the network fees (usually a fraction of a cent). Once connected, click on **My account** and find the **Start a new campaign** button.

## Where do I get CELO?
You can buy CELO using your debit card or bank account on [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) (a mobile wallet app) or through a cryptocurrency exchange. If it's not possible, ask me directly and I can send you 0.1 CELO.

## What does cUSD mean?
The Celo-Dollar (cUSD) is a stablecoin that mirrors the value of the US dollar. You can trade your cUSD against CELO (or the other way around) and even convert it to Mobile Money using [ChiSpend](https://chispend.com/).
